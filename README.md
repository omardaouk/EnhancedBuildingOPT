The main code of the model is in Omar_MA_Code.py ... and it builds on the original design_computation_5R1C_multi_obj.py

The functions used on this code are in functions_omar_MA.py

There is one run file: run_Omar_MA_Code.py that runs the whole code and from which one can choose which functions to use

The input data used by the model is the one contained in the folder input_data along with: 
the three CO2(t) txt files,
the electricity consumption in electricity_sfh_4_medium 8736.txt and sun.py
